# RenCrow Switch Core

Unofficial fork of [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) maintained for RenCrow. Not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.

Purpose: improve compaction so obsolete instructions do not survive as active commands, while preserving current requirements and capabilities. **Compaction work is in progress: accepted composer input has separate provenance, and `rencrow_compaction = true` connects the shared selection/review/summary pipeline to local Responses compaction. Runtime validation and deployment results are tracked in COMPACTION_SPEC.md; source availability alone is not a release acceptance.**

A Linux `dev-small` build has been installed locally as `rencrow-switch-core` for a Codex-switch trial. No public fork binary release is available. The original README below describes **official OpenAI Codex**, including its installers, services and support links; those commands do not install this fork.

## Quickstart

### Installing and running Codex CLI

Run the following on Mac or Linux to install Codex CLI:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

Run the following on Windows to install Codex CLI:

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex"
```

The standalone installers download from `https://releases.openai.com/codex` by default and fall back to GitHub Releases if a metadata or asset download is unavailable. To force GitHub Releases, set `CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM` to `false` (`0` and `no` are also accepted):

```shell
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM=false sh
```

```powershell
$env:CODEX_INSTALLER_USE_RELEASES_OPENAI_COM='false'; irm https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.ps1 | iex
```

Codex CLI can also be installed via the following package managers:

```shell
# Install using npm
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

```shell
# Install using Homebrew
brew install --cask codex
```

Then simply run `codex` to get started.

<summary>You can also go to the <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest">latest GitHub Release</a> and download the appropriate binary for your platform.</summary>

Each GitHub Release contains many executables, but in practice, you likely want one of these:

- macOS
  - Apple Silicon/arm64: `codex-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
  - x86_64 (older Mac hardware): `codex-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- Linux
  - x86_64: `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`
  - arm64: `codex-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`

Each archive contains a single entry with the platform baked into the name (e.g., `codex-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`), so you likely want to rename it to `codex` after extracting it.

### Using Codex with your ChatGPT plan

Run `codex` and select **Sign in with ChatGPT**. We recommend signing into your ChatGPT account to use Codex as part of your Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, or Enterprise plan. [Learn more about what's included in your ChatGPT plan](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11369540-codex-in-chatgpt).

You can also use Codex with an API key, but this requires [additional setup](https://developers.openai.com/codex/auth#sign-in-with-an-api-key).
